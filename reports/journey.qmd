<br> **Understanding Glioblastoma and Its Challenges** <br>


Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor and one of the toughest cancers to treat. Despite knowing a lot about its genetic makeup, this hasn’t translated into better survival rates for patients, with most living less than two years after diagnosis. The challenges lie in its ability to infiltrate the brain, its genetic diversity, and the protection offered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making it resistant to treatments like surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23937436/),[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32328653/).

**The Role of Lipids in GBM**<br>
Recent studies have revealed that GBM cells have unusual compositions of cholesterol and phospholipids in their membranes, affecting how growth-promoting signals operate. Scientists are particularly interested in sphingolipids, as the balance between sphingomyelin and ceramide is crucial for organizing cell membranes and clustering signaling molecules into lipid rafts. These rafts, which float in the cell membrane, can either attract or repel signaling proteins, thereby regulating cell signaling. This unique lipid environment in GBM cells could be a potential target for new treatments [3](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(16)30443-3).

**Exploring Acid Sphingomyelinase (ASM) and Its Inhibitors**<br>
Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine. In this report, we treated cells with ASM siRNA, Desipramine (an FDA-approved antidepressant), and α-mangostin (a natural compound with anti-cancer properties) Both Desiparamine and α-mangostin were shown to block ASM activities.
This study's findings are summarized in an interactive [Dashboard](https://clfee.github.io/website/reports/asm1.html#results).

**Key Findings from the Study**<br>
Our research identified around 530 proteins within lipid rafts, with 40% of them being influenced by ASM and its inhibitors. While 60% of the proteins remained unchanged, 40% involved in cell death, vesicle trafficking, and autophagy (a self-digestion process in cells) were affected. Autophagy can either help cancer cells survive under stress or lead to their death. Interestingly, inhibition of ASM led to increased levels of proteins associated with autophagy. However, this increase was not observed with Desipramine treatment. Desipramine was shown to have a dual effect, stimulatory and repressive on autophagy [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9133056/#R52). On the other hand,  α-mangostin, known to cause stress and autophagy in breast cancer cells [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051200418308029).We in α-mangostin treated samples, the levels of autophagy related proteins were down-regulated.

**Implications and Future Directions**<br>
This study sheds light on how ASM influences the lipid raft proteome in brain tumor cells, suggesting potential new avenues for treatment. Additionally, other research has indicated that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might have beneficial effects in various cancer models, including brain tumors. These insights could pave the way for new strategies in treating GBM, offering hope for better outcomes in the future.
