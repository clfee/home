With over 10 years of experience in cancer biology, I specialized in leveraging data analytical tools for omics study and biomarker discovery. Beyond the work, I have passion for animals, especially cats. I also enjoy gardening and exploring the world. Join me as I share insights from my scientific journey alongside my love for nature and adventure.
