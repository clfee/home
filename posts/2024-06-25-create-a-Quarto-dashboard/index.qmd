A while ago I wrote about creating a serverless dashboard (with no server dependencies) using [Flexdashboard](https://clfee.github.io/r/dashboard/crosstalk-dashboard/). As some of the functions now are no longer supported, I found a good alternative called "Quarto Dashboards". Quarto Dashboards allow to create dashboards using Python, R, Julia, and Observable. More details are [here](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/).

Dashboards can be created either using Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or using plain text markdown (.qmd). I am showing how to create one using RStudio.
